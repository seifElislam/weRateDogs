# weRateDogs
wrangle WeRateDogs Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations

# Project Overview

## Introduction:
The dataset that I will be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." WeRateDogs has over 6 million followers and has received international media coverage.

## Requirements:

- Python3
- Jupyter
- pandas
- NumPy
- requests
- tweepy
- json

## Wrangling steps:

### Gathering Data
Data is gathered from Udacity servers and Twitter API.

### Assessing Data
1. Two types of assessment are used:
   - Visual assessment: each piece of gathered data is displayed in the Jupyter Notebook for visual assessment purposes.
   - Programmatic assessment: pandas' functions and/or methods are used to assess the data.
2. eight (8) data quality issues and two (2) tidiness issues are detected.

### Cleaning Data
- The define, code, and test steps of the cleaning process are clearly documented.
- Copies of the original pieces of data are made prior to cleaning.
- All issues identified in the assess phase are successfully cleaned using Python and pandas.
- A tidy master dataset with all pieces of gathered data is created.

### Report
Two reports:
- wrangling efforts are briefly described in wrangle_report.pdf.
- Insights found are communicated in act_report.pdf including visualization.
